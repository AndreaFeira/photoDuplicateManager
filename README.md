# photoDuplicateManager
Scans a specified folder (and its subfolders) for exact duplicate images (100% perceptual hash match). Hashes are computed in parallel, with a real-time progress bar and ETA. Exact duplicates can be moved to a “duplicates” subfolder under a user-specified path if the -m option is used.
